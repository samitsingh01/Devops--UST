What is an IP Address?
📌 Definition:
An IP (Internet Protocol) address is like your home address on the internet. It allows devices (computers, phones, servers) to find each other and communicate.

🧩 Types of IP Address:
Type	Example	Use
IPv4	192.168.1.1	Most common; 4 numbers (0-255) separated by dots
IPv6	2001:db8::1	Newer; for many more devices (longer format)
Public IP	13.58.120.33	Accessible over the internet
Private IP	192.168.1.10	Used within home or office networks only
Static IP	Fixed address	Does not change (useful for servers)
Dynamic IP	Changes often	Assigned by ISPs, usually to home users

🛠️ How Devices Use IP:
Your PC: 192.168.1.2 (private IP)

Router: 192.168.1.1 (gateway IP)

Server on AWS: 13.58.120.33 (public IP)

📏 2. What is a Subnet?
📌 Definition:
A subnet (sub-network) is a smaller network inside a bigger network. It helps organize and manage IP addresses.

🎯 Why Subnet?
Improves network efficiency.

Increases security (separate sensitive devices).

Controls traffic flow.

📊 Subnet Example:
Item	Example
Subnet Address	192.168.1.0/24
Subnet Mask	255.255.255.0
Usable IP Range	192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254
Total IPs	256 (254 usable)

🎯 What does /24 mean?
It's CIDR notation.

/24 means first 24 bits are for network, 8 bits for devices.

Equivalent to 255.255.255.0 subnet mask.

📦 Subnetting in Real Life:
A company network has subnets for:

Office PCs

Servers

Printers

Guest Wi-Fi

Each group gets a separate subnet for better security and management.

☁️ 3. What is AWS (Amazon Web Services)?
📌 Definition:
AWS is a cloud computing platform by Amazon that provides on-demand IT services like:

Servers (EC2)

Storage (S3)

Databases (RDS)

Networking (VPC)

🧰 Key AWS Services:
Service	What it Does
EC2	Virtual servers (you control OS, IP, etc.)
S3	File storage (images, videos, backups)
RDS	Managed databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
VPC	Virtual network (create subnets, assign IPs)
Lambda	Serverless functions (run code without servers)

🌐 AWS IP Example:
You launch an EC2 instance.

AWS gives it:

Private IP (for inside AWS network)

Public IP (for internet access)

🛠️ AWS VPC and Subnet Example:
Item	Example
VPC	10.0.0.0/16 (big network)
Subnet 1	10.0.1.0/24 (web servers)
Subnet 2	10.0.2.0/24 (databases)
Internet Gateway	Gives public internet access

🗂️ IP + Subnet + AWS in Action:
You create a VPC (like a private office network in the cloud).

Divide it into subnets:

One for public servers (web apps)

One for private servers (databases)

Assign IP addresses to each server.

Use security groups and routing to control access.

🔐 Security Groups (Bonus)
Like firewalls in AWS.

Control which IPs can access your server (e.g., only allow port 80 for web).

🧠 Summary Table
Term	Simple Meaning
IP Address	Unique ID for a device on a network
Subnet	Subdivision of network for better management
AWS	Cloud service platform by Amazon
VPC	Virtual private network in AWS
EC2	Virtual server in AWS
